# Medical Appointment Booking Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation (or planned implementation) of a comprehensive Medical Appointment Booking Platform. The platform enables patients to register, book appointments with doctors across various medical disciplines, and manage their bookings efficiently. Doctors can manage their schedules, receive notifications for new appointments, and handle cancellations. Administrators have full control over users, medical disciplines, and resources such as devices or equipment.

The system is designed to prevent double-bookings for doctors and resources, ensure seamless notifications, and provide a user-friendly experience for all roles: patients, doctors, and admins. It prioritizes data security, availability checks, and modular extensibility.

## Features

The platform incorporates the following key features based on the system requirements:

### 1. User Management
- Patient registration with essential personal information.
- Secure patient login using credentials.
- Admin functionality to add and manage doctor profiles.

### 2. Discipline and Doctor Selection
- Home page display of available medical disciplines (e.g., Internal Medicine, Orthopedics).
- List of available doctors shown upon discipline selection.

### 3. Appointment Booking
- Patients can select and book appointments with available doctors.
- Automated checks for doctor and resource/device availability during booking.
- Automatic reservation of required devices or resources.
- Robust prevention of double-bookings for both doctors and devices.

### 4. Doctor Schedule Management
- Doctors can set and update their availability schedules.
- Real-time notifications for newly booked appointments (e.g., via email or in-app alerts).
- Ability for doctors to cancel appointments in urgent cases.
- Personalized view of upcoming appointment schedules.

### 5. Admin Control
- Management of user accounts for patients and doctors.
- Oversight of medical disciplines, including additions and updates.
- Control over medical devices and resources.

### 6. Device/Resource Management
- Admin tools to add, edit, and manage devices or resources (e.g., equipment, rooms).
- Automatic scheduling and allocation of devices based on appointment needs.

### 7. Appointment Management for Patients
- View of upcoming appointments.
- Option to cancel appointments.

### Additional Notes
- Certain appointments require specific devices/resources, which are scheduled automatically upon booking.
- Notifications to doctors are handled flexibly (e.g., email or in-app), with potential for expansion.
- The admin role provides overarching control; future enhancements could include reporting features or analytics.

## System Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. It can be built using modern technologies such as:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript — responsive UI for Patients, Doctors and Admins
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core MVC (C#, .NET 8) — controllers + Web APIs for user management, booking logic, scheduling and notifications.
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server (relational) — stores users, specialties, doctors’ schedules, appointments and resources; accessed via Entity Framework Core (Code-First + Migrations).
- **Authentication**: JWT (Bearer tokens) with role-based access control (roles: Admin / Doctor / Patient). Optionally add OAuth2 for third-party sign-in.
